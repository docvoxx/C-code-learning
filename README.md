# üìò C-Journey-piedTeam

> **My personal journey learning the C programming language with the piedTeam core.**  
> This repository is a collection of small exercises and mini-projects that helped me build a solid foundation in C ‚Äî covering everything from basic syntax to loops, conditionals, classic algorithms, and input handling.  
> I hope this log will inspire or help other beginners starting out with C!

## üìå About

This repository documents my progress as I learn and practice C programming.  
Each file is named to show its topic ‚Äî from simple `if-else` checks to prime number calculations and Fibonacci series.

These exercises were done as part of my study with the **piedTeam core**, a small group focused on improving programming fundamentals through hands-on practice.
